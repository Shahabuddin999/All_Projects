	    What is a Deadlock in Threads?
		A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for a resource (lock) that the other thread holds.
		In simple terms:
		Thread A waits for a lock held by Thread B, while Thread B waits for a lock held by Thread A â€” they never proceed.
		
		Real-World Analogy:
		Person A has Lock 1, and wants Lock 2
		Person B has Lock 2, and wants Lock 1
